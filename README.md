## 👀 How to use

1. **Open the App**:
   - After installing, click `Saturn-Builder.exe` to start.
   - The first time, it will ask to install some tools. Click **Install Dependencies** to get started, or **Skip for Now** if you want to try it later (but you won’t be able to make apps yet).

2. **Pick a Language**:
   - Choose English or Russian from a dropdown menu in the app.
   - The app will change its language right away!

3. **Start or Open a Project**:
   - Click **Create New Project** to begin a new app, or **Load Project** to open one you’ve worked on before.
   - Tell the app where your project is saved and pick what kind of file you want (like APK).

4. **Build Your App**:
   - Choose how you want to build your app (the app will guide you).
   - If you need a special key for your app, follow the steps to add it.
   - Click **Build** and watch the progress on the screen.

5. **Get Your App**:
   - When it’s done, your app files (APK or AAB) will be in your project folder, and the folder will open so you can see them!

## 🛠️ What It Needs

Saturn-Builder downloads these tools automatically:
- **Node.js**: Helps run the app-making process.
- **JDK 17**: A tool to prepare your app for Android.
- **Android SDK**: Tools to build Android apps.
- **Gradle**: Helps put everything together.
- **Cordova CLI**: Makes apps from web projects.

For the app’s look:
- **CustomTkinter**: Creates the easy interface.
- **Pillow**: Helps with pictures (like the icon).

You’ll need about 1 GB of space for all this.
